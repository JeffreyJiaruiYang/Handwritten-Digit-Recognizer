This project is a Python-based application for recognizing handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. It also includes a GUI for drawing and testing digit recognition.

## Run
Use python ui.py
## Features
- Train a CNN model on the MNIST dataset.
- Save and load the trained model for reuse.
- GUI interface for drawing and recognizing digits in real-time.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following libraries:
- `torch` (for building and training the neural network)
- `torchvision` (for the MNIST dataset and image transformations)
- `Pillow` (for image processing)
- `tkinter` (for the GUI interface)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
- `opencv-python` (for image preprocessing)
- `ttkbootstrap` (for better UI)

Install dependencies via:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision Pillow opencv-python numpy
